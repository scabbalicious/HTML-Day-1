<h2>Brought to you by the good people at PunchCode!</h2></div>
<p align="center">Thank you for taking the time to visit my small corner of the world. But please don't leave yet. I've got a story to tell. So do stick around for a few minutes.</p>
<div><h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
<p>We've already covered my name, but here is a little more about me. I was born and raised in Virginia; not too far from the ocean and not too far from the Chesapeake Bay. I grew up on a steady diet of Thundercats and Nintendo. And Chips Ahoy cookies, which explains why I was a little chubby kid. I wanted to be a doctor, so like a good boy I went through school and college and studied my ass off to be the best doctor out there. And then, one day, I decided I didn't want to be a doctor. So I moved to Japan for a few years to find myself, got tired of that and then moved to Las Vegas to start doing some actual adulting.</p>
<h3>Wait...Japan?</h3>
<p>Yes. And there is a lot of other stuff that happened too. But don't worry about that now. Stay focused.</p>
<h3>So why programming?</h3>
<p><span id="Hilight">Good question.</span> I've always been interested in computers, even though I've never been very good at understanding what's going on under the hood. And I've always been interested in creating things online.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Apps</li>
	<li>Websites</li>
	<li>Games</li>
</ul>
<p>But I've never been able to actually build anything. Until now. I am taking the first big, bold step to become an actual programmer.</p>

<h3>Again...why programming?</h3>
<p>Programming, when mastered, is a skill that can be done anywhere around the world. And often, at any time. One doesn't need to be stuck in an office, or even in a particular city. One simply needs an internet connection and a device that can produce code. I want to work, but I also want to travel and experience things. And I want to create, and have my creations hopefully live on and be useful to others.<br></p>
<p align="center"><b>Programming is my means to that end.</b></p></div>
